# BLE-Control — Wearable BLE Controller (Altium AD25 + IEC 60601-style Design)

**BLE-Control** is a small, low-power wearable control board built around the **STM32WB55 (BLE 5 + Cortex-M4)**, with USB-C power/charging, a protected 3.3 V system rail, and a switchable sensor domain feeding an IMU, precision temperature sensor, and humidity/temperature sensor. It is intended as an external “controller/companion” style board for BLE-connected systems where robust power, RF, and sensor handling matter more than raw throughput.

This is a portfolio/showcase design intentionally aligned to **IEC 60601-1** (basic safety & essential performance) and **IEC 60601-1-2 Ed.4** (EMC, Class A – professional healthcare environment) habits, with documentation patterns influenced by **ISO 13485** (QMS) and **ISO 14971** (risk). The repo is structured to look and feel like a lightweight Design History File: schematic and BoM, safety/EMC rationale, risk register, battery documentation, and bring-up/test notes are all linked and traceable from the `/Docs` folder.

- USB-C hardened with:  
  - PPTC  
  - VBUS TVS  
  - CC ESD  
  - USBLC6  
  - Common-mode choke  
  - Shield bleed `1 MΩ // 1 nF C0G`  

### 2. MCU + RF (STM32WB55)

- Dual-core + BLE 5  
- USB FS with 22 Ω series  
- 32 MHz HSE + 32.768 kHz LSE  
- On-chip SMPS with 10 µH + (optional 10 nH helper)  
- RF feed → π-match (DNP default) → Johanson antenna  
- SWD via **Tag-Connect TC2030-CTX-NL**

### 3. Sensors + I/O

- TMP117 (precision temperature)  
- BMI270 (IMU)  
- SHTC3 (humidity/T)  
- All on **3V3_SENS** gated by MCU  
- Button with ESD + RC + 100 Ω

#  BLE-Control — Bring-Up & Testing Summary

This document captures the recommended bring-up flow and key test procedures for the BLE-Control hardware platform.


##  Recommended Bring-Up Order

### 1. **Verify Power Path & Rails**
- Power via USB-C or bench supply.
- Confirm:
  - `VBUS`
  - `VBAT_RAW`
  - `VBAT_PROT`
  - `PMID`
  - `+3V3_SYS` (TPS7A02 output)
- Check for ripple, inrush anomalies, or unstable startup.

### 2. **Flash STM32WB55 (SMPS-bypass mode)**
- Leave SMPS inductors populated or install 0 Ω bypass links.
- Program using Tag-Connect TC2030-CTX-NL.
- Load minimal firmware (heartbeat LED + UART/SWV optional).

### 3. **Enable Charger & Monitor `BQ_INT`**
- Validate:
  - USB attachment detection
  - Correct CC pull-down behaviour
  - BQ21061 charge state transitions
  - `BQ_INT` on MCU (falling-edge EXTI)

### 4. **Bring Up Sensors (`SENS_EN` → `3V3_SENS`)**
- Assert `SENS_EN` → TPS22910A enables the sensor rail.
- Confirm correct voltage and soft-start behaviour.
- Check I²C access to:
  - TMP117
  - BMI270
  - SHTC3

### 5. **Enable SMPS & Verify Ripple**
- Populate SMPS inductors (10 µH + optional 10 nH helper).
- Remove any bypass 0 Ω links if used.
- Measure ripple on:
  - `VLXSMPS`
  - `VDD`
  - `+3V3_SYS`

### 6. **RF Bring-Up + π-Match Tuning**
- Conduct preliminary RF tests:
  - Return-loss sweep of antenna
  - Harmonic scan
  - π-match population depending on results

### 7. **Run STM32CubeMonitor-RF PER Tests**
- Validate BLE link margin.
- Test across multiple channels.
- Measure Packet Error Rate (PER) at various distances and orientations.
