# BLE-Control — BLE-Enabled Wearable Controller

**BLE-Control** is a compact, low-power BLE-enabled wearable controller designed to interface with an external device or implant via Bluetooth Low Energy.  
This project demonstrates end-to-end hardware design with firmware integration points, suitable for medical, wearable, or embedded control applications.
